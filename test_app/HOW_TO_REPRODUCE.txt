Workflow and Issue Description

    Workflow: In the encrypted image workflow, the image consists of a 512-byte header, followed by the actual encrypted image content.
    In the test, device begins downloading the image without any restart until it reaches 530 bytes. 
    Once the downloaded data size exceeds 530 bytes, the content is saved in NVS using the save_ota_state_to_nvs() function, followed by an explicit device restart using esp_restart(). 
    On reboot, the stored context is retrieved from NVS using the load_decrypt_handle_from_nvs() function to resume the process.

Issue Description: 
    During execution, the Cache_buf_len increases until it reaches 15 and then resets to 0 repeatedly, creating a loop. At this stage, the following error was observed:

    Guru Meditation Error: Core  0 panic'ed (Store access fault). Exception was unhandled.

    0x4200f1c0: process_bin at /home/nilesh/esp/extra_components/idf-extra-components/esp_encrypted_img/src/esp_encrypted_img.c:202

Steps to Reproduce:

    Navigate to the directory: idf-extra-components/test_app
    Set the target to esp32c3.
    Build the project.
    Flash the firmware and monitor the device.
